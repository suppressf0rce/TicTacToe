#TicTacToe

**Brief information:**

This software is demo project that shows how the TCP Sockets work in java.<br>
It is based on the TicTacToe game, which has one server and multiple clients.

The user has option to choose whether to host the server or to start as client.

Clients have to login to the specified server to access the lobby. User info is encrypted and saved into database.<br>
If the client does not have account he can create one.

There is encrypted chat between the clients when they are in game, that goes through the server

Client can challenge other clients that are currently in loby and not busy playing with other players
